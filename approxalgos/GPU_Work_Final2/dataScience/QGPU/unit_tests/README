QGPU Unit tests:
===============================

Currently the unit tests cover all functionality, and perform tests with
I1 and I4 datatypes. To cover other datatypes would be a simple
extension. The test scripts for each of the functions are located under
the appropriate directories, and the tests are name test*.sh. If reqd,
once could easily create additional tests following the same pattern as
existing tests.

To run unit tests, please follow these steps:
-------------------------------
1. Make sure the QGPU server is setup to read files from the unit tests
data directory. To do this, on the server side, set the Q_DOCROOT envt variable to the unit_tests/data directory.

export Q_DOCROOT=<path_to_QGPU>/unit_tests/data

2. On the client side, generate the test data files. The script generate_test_data.sh does this. Just run it. 
(Please note, the tests need the qtils utility which encodes a given
command into a URL. The path of this utility has to be available in
$PATH. If not, please add it. The qtils utility has been provided in the
utils directory along with this package. To add that to the path, do
export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_QGPU>/utils
)

source generate_test_data.sh

3. Run the unit tests. The script run_unit_tests.sh does this. Just run
it.

source run_unit_tests.sh

4. For cleanup, we've provided a script cleanup.sh which deletes the
test data.

source cleanup.sh
