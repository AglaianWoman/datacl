This utility reports the CPU-GPU bandwidth for varying data sizes.

Directions:
===============================
We assume cuda sdk/samples are available in
/usr/local/cuda/samples/common/inc/
If not, change the include path accordingly.
If you do not have the samples installed, you'll have to delete all
occurences of checkCudaErrors() from the source file.

To measure only CPU-GPU transfers set the tran_GPU2CPU macro to 0.
To use more precise CUDA timers, declare the macro cudaTIMER.
If you want to average over a number of iterations/transfers, set the
appropriate value to the NUMITER macro.


Compile:
-----------------
nvcc -o gpu_bandwidth_test -I/usr/local/cuda/samples/common/inc/ gpu_bandwidth_test.cpp

Run:
-----------------
./gpu_bandwidth_test
