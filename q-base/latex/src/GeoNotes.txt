PARENT_COUNTRY_CODE is not used
RADIUS_BUFFER_MI    is not used
GRANULARITY is CITY, STATE, NONE

GRANULARITY = STATE is used in ad targeting

GEO_PLACE_CODE is any string. However, currently it emebds the hierarchy in
it.
GEO_PLACE_CODE is unique within a country, not across countries.


The field GEO_NAME_ADMIN_CODE in geo_places_XX.xml is produced only when
GRANULARITY=STATE and in such cases, it is the abbreviation e.g., CA for
California

Ethan wrote as follows
"When the place is not a STAT, the admin code is not used. 
I don't know what they mean."

Hence, I will produce GEO_NAME_ADMIN_CODE only when GRANULARITY=STAT


Ethan wrote as follows:
GEO_NAME_ADMIN_CODE, if present for states, means the abbreviated state name.
It doesn't have to be two letters. When it's absent, then there is no (known)
state name abbreviation. We should probably still populate it with the English
name of the state, but there is no requirement for it so far.


Geo places do NOT get translated (mail from Alexis)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
GEO_NAME_ID -- no idea what it is. Leave it as some unique integer.
latitude != null => longitude != null
longitude != null => latitude != null
latitude != null => geo_name_id != null

Ramesh to Ethan: 
 can a region_code be assigned to more than one state?

<geo_state_region_map COUNTRY_CODE="us" STATE_CODE="AZ" REGION_CODE="49"/>
<geo_state_region_map COUNTRY_CODE="us" STATE_CODE="AZ" REGION_CODE="262"/>
<geo_state_region_map COUNTRY_CODE="us" STATE_CODE="AZ" REGION_CODE="412"/>
<geo_state_region_map COUNTRY_CODE="us" STATE_CODE="AZ" REGION_CODE="620"/>
<geo_state_region_map COUNTRY_CODE="us" STATE_CODE="AZ" REGION_CODE="852"/>
<geo_state_region_map COUNTRY_CODE="us" STATE_CODE="AZ" REGION_CODE="936"/>
<geo_state_region_map COUNTRY_CODE="us" STATE_CODE="CA" REGION_CODE="49"/>

Ethan to Ramesh: 
Yes. That's an issue of the current data â€“ we over count members in some
states. For example, the Washington DC region is mapped to DC, West Virginia,
and Maryland, and the member count for each of those states will include the
ones in that region.
